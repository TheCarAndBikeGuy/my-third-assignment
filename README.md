# my-third-assignment

I believe I met the requirements of a title, a counter that goes up by one on its own, a clicker which is a GIF, and the use of the clicker. I also added in the table and some facts as to how much clicks the upgrades are so users have a full undertanding on how to use the webpage and how much the items are. I also labelled the upgrades and gave them a number at the bottom telling the user how many of those upgrades they have. I found the positioning a littl difficult trying to work out what goes where, and I found adding the clicker in a little difficult.
